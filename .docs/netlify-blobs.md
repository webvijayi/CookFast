# Netlify Blobs Integration in CookFast

This document outlines how Netlify Blobs is used in the CookFast application for document generation and storage.

## Overview

Netlify Blobs is used as a key-value store for persisting generated documentation. The implementation follows these principles:

1. In production environments, all data is stored exclusively in Netlify Blobs
2. In local development, the filesystem is used as a fallback
3. The implementation uses strong consistency for reads to ensure the latest data is retrieved

## Key Components

### 1. Storage Implementation (`saveResult.ts`)

The core storage functionality is implemented in `src/utils/saveResult.ts`:

- Uses `getStore()` from `@netlify/blobs` to create a site-wide store
- Includes comprehensive error handling and logging
- Automatically detects Netlify environments

### 2. Data Retrieval (`check-status.ts`) 

The API endpoint at `src/pages/api/check-status.ts` handles retrieving stored documents:

- Uses the same store name for consistency
- Implements proper validation of document structure
- Includes detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Configuration

The Netlify configuration in `netlify.toml` includes:

```toml
[build.environment]
  NETLIFY_BLOBS_CONTEXT = "production"
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
```

## Local Development

When developing locally:

1. The application automatically detects non-Netlify environments
2. Files are stored in the local `tmp` directory
3. The directory structure mimics the key-value approach used in Netlify Blobs

## Limitations and Considerations

- Netlify Blobs has a size limit of 5GB per object
- Local development can't access production data
- The implementation doesn't include automatic cleanup of old documents

## Testing the Implementation

To verify Netlify Blobs is working correctly:

1. Deploy the application to Netlify
2. Generate a document
3. Check the Network tab to confirm the document is retrieved from Netlify Blobs
4. Verify that download, copy, and display functions work correctly

## Troubleshooting

If issues occur with Netlify Blobs:

1. Check the function logs in the Netlify dashboard
2. Verify the NETLIFY_BLOBS_CONTEXT environment variable is set correctly
3. Ensure Node.js 18+ is being used (for native fetch API support)

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for the Netlify Blobs implementation:

1. Implement document expiration/cleanup logic
2. Add blob listing functionality in admin interfaces
3. Create a migration utility for moving between storage systems
