## Tips for Better Results

### 1. Be Specific with Project Details

The more specific and detailed your project information, the better the generated documentation will be. Include:

- Detailed feature descriptions
- Specific technologies in your tech stack
- Target audience or user personas, if applicable

### 2. Choose the Right Provider

Different AI providers have different strengths:

- **Gemini**: Good general-purpose documentation with advanced code generation
- **OpenAI/GPT-4.1**: Strong at generating comprehensive and well-structured documentation
- **Claude**: Excellent at following detailed instructions and producing high-quality text

### 3. Select Relevant Document Types

Only select the document types that are relevant to your project. For example:

- If your project doesn't have a backend, don't select "Backend Structure"
- If you're not using AI systems, don't select "System Prompts"

### 4. Review and Customize

Generated documentation should be treated as a starting point:

1. Review the content for accuracy
2. Customize it to match your specific requirements
3. Add additional details where necessary

## Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues

If you encounter issues with your API key:

1. Verify that you've entered the correct API key
2. Ensure your API key has the necessary permissions
3. Check that your API key hasn't expired
4. Verify that your account has sufficient credits/quota

### Generation Timeout

2. Consider using a different AI provider
3. Simplify your project description
4. Retry the generation process

### Content Quality Issues

If the generated content doesn't meet your expectations:

1. Try providing more detailed project information
