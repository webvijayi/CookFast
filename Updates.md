- **Project Structure & Layout:**
  - Created `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` with logo, navigation links (#features, #how-it-works, #faq, #generate), and theme toggle.
  - Created `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx` with copyright info and links (GitHub, Report Issue).
  - Created `src/components/layout/MainLayout.tsx` to wrap pages with Header and Footer.
  - Updated `src/pages/_app.tsx` to use `MainLayout`, removing standalone theme toggle.
- **Styling & Design System:**
  - Updated `src/styles/globals.css`:
    - Switched to `@import \"tailwindcss\"`.
    - Defined CSS variables using OKLCH format for light/dark modes following 60/30/10 rule.
    - Registered variables using `@theme` directive.
    - Added modern gradient variables (`--gradient-brand-light/dark`, `--gradient-subtle-light/dark`).
    - Added `scroll-behavior: smooth`.
    - Removed old theme toggle and gradient helper styles.
  - Updated `tailwind.config.js`:
    - Removed hardcoded `theme.extend.colors`.
    - Added `container` configuration.
    - Added `tailwindcss-animate` plugin and keyframes/animations (`accordion-down`, `accordion-up`, `fade-in`).
    - Registered gradient variables as background image utilities.
- **Page Content (`src/pages/index.tsx`):**
  - Refactored the monolithic component into sections: `HeroSection`, `FeaturesSection`, `HowItWorksSection`, `FaqSection`, `GeneratorSection`.
  - Added section IDs for navigation.
  - Implemented Hero section with gradient background, engaging headline, tagline, CTA buttons (Generate, GitHub), and placeholder image.
  - Implemented Features section with card layout, updated copy, and subtle gradient background.
  - Implemented How It Works section with 3-step process description.
  - Implemented FAQ section using `shadcn/ui Accordion`.
  - Restructured the main form/generator logic within `GeneratorSection` using `shadcn/ui` components (`Card`, `Input`, `Textarea`, `Label`, `RadioGroup`, `Checkbox`, `Button`).
  - Applied `animate-fade-in` to sections and elements.
  - Updated `Head` metadata (title, description, keywords, JSON-LD schema).
  - Added/fixed prop types and handler signatures for section components.
- **Components:**
  - Installed missing `shadcn/ui` components: `input`, `textarea`, `label`, `radio-group`, `checkbox`, `card`, `accordion`.
  - Fixed type errors and corrected `
