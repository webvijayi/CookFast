## 2024-10-16 - Fixed API structure mismatch in document generation

### Development Steps

1. Fixed `src/components/GeneratorSection.tsx`:
   - Corrected the API call body structure in the `handleSubmit` function
   - Changed from sending flattened project details to properly structured objects
   - Ensured `projectDetails` and `selectedDocs` are sent as complete objects matching the API's expected format

2. Enhanced logging in `src/pages/api/generate-docs.ts`:
   - Added debug logging to help diagnose API request structure issues
   - Improved validation by checking the complete request structure

### Key Decisions

- Maintained the original API structure requiring nested objects instead of flattening the data
- Added additional logging to help identify similar issues in the future
- Preserved all existing validation logic while ensuring proper object structure

### Next Steps

1. Add similar debug logging to other API endpoints for consistency
2. Consider adding TypeScript interface validation for API request bodies
3. Improve error messages to be more specific about structure mismatches
4. Test all form submission flows to verify proper data structure

## 2024-10-17 - Fixed Document Generation and Added JSON Download

### Development Steps

1. Fixed document generation in `src/pages/api/generate-docs.ts`:
   - Improved prompt instructions to explicitly request complete content instead of outlines
   - Increased token limits for all AI providers to allow for more comprehensive output
   - Added warning emojis and stronger emphasis on generating detailed documentation
   - Reduced temperature parameter to 0.3 for more focused, deterministic output
   - Enhanced the system prompts for all three AI providers

2. Added JSON download functionality in `src/components/GeneratorSection.tsx`:
   - Created a new success state UI section that appears after successful generation
   - Implemented JSON download button with proper file naming
   - Added a secondary copy-to-clipboard button for easy access to content
   - Displayed generation statistics (time, content length, sections)
   - Fixed event handling for generation success events

### Key Decisions

- Maintained specific, directive language in AI prompts to prevent outline-only responses
- Used lower temperature settings (0.3) to produce more consistent, focused documentation
- Added visual feedback with a success state UI that clearly indicates successful generation
- Implemented direct file download rather than requiring users to copy and paste content

### Next Steps

1. Add support for downloading individual document sections
2. Implement markdown download option in addition to JSON
3. Add a preview mode to see the generated content before downloading
4. Consider implementing document template options for different project types
5. Add automatic saving of generated documents for registered users

## [2023-09-15] Fixed Documentation Generation Issue

### Changes:
- Fixed the API response structure in `src/pages/api/generate-docs.ts` to ensure proper document generation
- Updated error handling for Gemini API responses to better handle content extraction
- Enhanced the front-end handling of documentation sections in `src/components/GeneratorSection.tsx`
- Added fallback handling when no documentation sections are found
- Added visual alert icon for empty documentation states
- Created `AlertTriangleIcon` component for improved error/warning states

### Technical Details:
- The main issue was with how the API response was structured and how sections were parsed
- Modified response format to properly include content and sections
- Added fallback section creation if no sections were found in the API response
- Enhanced error handling for the API calls

## [2023-09-17] Removed Fallback Content Generation

### Changes:
- Removed fallback logic from `src/components/GeneratorSection.tsx` that created default sections when API response lacked structured sections.
- Removed fallback logic from `src/pages/index.tsx` in the `handleGenerationSuccess` handler to prevent creation of default sections.
- Removed fallback logic from `src/pages/index.tsx` in the `parseMarkdownSections` utility function.
- Ensured the application strictly relies on the API-generated content and sections.
- Added warnings when API response lacks expected structure instead of generating fallback content.

### Technical Details:
- Focused on robust API response handling and error reporting.
- Prioritized displaying only the content received from the API, even if unstructured.
- Ensured UI handles empty sections gracefully without errors.

## [2023-09-18] Enhanced API Robustness and Error Handling

### Changes:
- Refactored API handler (`src/pages/api/generate-docs.ts`):
  - Enhanced `parseContentToSections` to handle H1/H2 headings more flexibly and provide a single-section fallback if parsing fails.
  - Added `maxOutputTokens` configuration to the Gemini API call for consistency.
  - Wrapped individual provider API calls in `try...catch` blocks for specific error logging.
  - Implemented more specific HTTP status codes (401, 429, 400, 500) based on common API error messages (key issues, quota, etc.).
  - Added specific error handling for cases where the AI provider returns empty content.
- Improved frontend error handling (`src/components/GeneratorSection.tsx`):
  - Modified `handleSubmit` to attempt parsing JSON error details from failed API responses.
  - Display more specific error messages to the user based on API feedback.
- Simplified frontend parsing (`src/pages/index.tsx`):
  - Removed redundant `parseMarkdownSections` logic from the `handleGenerationSuccess` event handler.
  - Ensured the UI relies solely on the `sections` data provided by the API.

### Technical Details:
- Improved reliability of section parsing from generated Markdown.
- Made API calls more consistent across providers (Gemini token limit).
- Enhanced error diagnostics by differentiating API provider errors and returning appropriate HTTP status codes.
- Provided clearer error feedback to the user on the frontend.
- Streamlined frontend state management by removing unnecessary parsing.

## [2023-09-19] Fixed Metadata, Prompt Quality, and Downloads

### Changes:
- **Metadata Fix:** Corrected the `convertToJSON` function in `src/pages/index.tsx` to use the actual provider/model returned by the API (stored in state) instead of the user-selected provider, ensuring accurate JSON download metadata.
- **Prompt Enhancement:** Significantly improved the prompt in `src/pages/api/generate-docs.ts` to explicitly request detailed narrative explanations, examples (code, config), and justifications for each documentation section, aiming for higher quality and less outline-like output.
- **Download Markdown Fix:** Refactored the `handleDownload` and `downloadContent` functions in `src/pages/index.tsx` to ensure the Markdown download works reliably. Added checks for content existence, improved filename generation (using actual provider as fallback), added UTF-8 encoding, and made link cleanup more robust.

### Technical Details:
- Added `actualProviderUsed` and `actualModelUsed` state to `CookFastHome`.
- Updated `handleGenerationSuccess` to populate the new state variables.
- Modified `convertToJSON` to read from the new state variables.
- Heavily revised instructions within `buildPrompt` for detailed content generation.
- Added error handling and logging to `downloadContent` and `handleDownload`.
- Ensured correct Blob type and robust cleanup for file downloads.

## [2023-09-20] Final Fixes for Document Generation & Downloads

### Changes:
- **Metadata Fix (JSON Download):** Ensured the actual API provider/model info is correctly passed to and used by the `convertToJSON` function by adding `debugInfo` state and passing it through props, fixing the hardcoded/incorrect metadata issue.
- **Hydration Error Fix:** Adjusted the `MarkdownRenderer` component by adding a custom `p` tag renderer to prevent invalid nesting of block elements (`div`, `pre`) within paragraphs, resolving the console hydration errors.
- **Incorrect Message Fix:** Removed the faulty content length check (`content.length < 2000`) from `MarkdownRenderer` that was incorrectly causing the "Content appears incomplete" message to display for valid sections.
- **Download Markdown Debugging:** Added detailed `console.log` statements to the `handleDownload` function in `src/pages/index.tsx` to trace execution and identify potential failure points in the download process.

### Technical Details:
- Utilized state (`debugInfo`) and prop drilling (`ResultsPanel`) to pass correct API response data to the JSON download function.
- Implemented a custom `p` component in `react-markdown`'s `components` prop to handle block element rendering correctly.
- Removed heuristic length check from `MarkdownRenderer`'s `useEffect`.
- Added granular logging to `handleDownload` for better diagnostics.
