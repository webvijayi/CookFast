These comprehensive fixes ensure that the form validation works correctly across all components and that data is properly passed from the form to the API.

## 2024-10-16 - Fixed API structure mismatch in document generation

### Development Steps

1. Fixed `src/components/GeneratorSection.tsx`:
   - Corrected the API call body structure in the `handleSubmit` function
   - Changed from sending flattened project details to properly structured objects
   - Ensured `projectDetails` and `selectedDocs` are sent as complete objects matching the API's expected format

2. Enhanced logging in `src/pages/api/generate-docs.ts`:

   - Improved validation by checking the complete request structure

### Key Decisions

- Maintained the original API structure requiring nested objects instead of flattening the data
- Added additional logging to help identify similar issues in the future
- Preserved all existing validation logic while ensuring proper object structure

### Next Steps

1. Add similar debug logging to other API endpoints for consistency
2. Consider adding TypeScript interface validation for API request bodies

- Enhanced error handling for the API calls

## [2023-09-17] Removed Fallback Content Generation

### Changes:
- Removed fallback logic from `src/components/GeneratorSection.tsx` that created default sections when API response lacked structured sections.
- Removed fallback logic from `src/pages/index.tsx` in the `handleGenerationSuccess` handler to prevent creation of default sections.
- Removed fallback logic from `src/pages/index.tsx` in the `parseMarkdownSections` utility function.

## [2023-09-18] Enhanced API Robustness and Error Handling

### Changes:
- Refactored API handler (`src/pages/api/generate-docs.ts`):
  - Enhanced `parseContentToSections` to handle H1/H2 headings more flexibly and provide a single-section fallback if parsing fails.
  - Added `maxOutputTokens` configuration to the Gemini API call for consistency.
  - Wrapped individual provider API calls in `try...catch` blocks for specific error logging.
  - Implemented more specific HTTP status codes (401, 429, 400, 500) based on common API error messages (key issues, quota, etc.).
  - Added specific error handling for cases where the AI provider returns empty content.
- Improved frontend error handling (`src/components/GeneratorSection.tsx`):
  - Modified `handleSubmit` to attempt parsing JSON error details from failed API responses.
  - Display more specific error messages to the user based on API feedback.
- Simplified frontend parsing (`src/pages/index.tsx`):
  - Removed redundant `parseMarkdownSections` logic from the `handleGenerationSuccess` event handler.
  - Ensured the UI relies solely on the `sections` data provided by the API.

### Technical Details:
- Improved reliability of section parsing from generated Markdown.
- Made API calls more consistent across providers (Gemini token limit).
- Enhanced error diagnostics by differentiating API provider errors and returning appropriate HTTP status codes.
- Provided clearer error feedback to the user on the frontend.
- Streamlined frontend state management by removing unnecessary parsing.

## [2023-09-19] Fixed Metadata, Prompt Quality, and Downloads

### Changes:
- **Metadata Fix:** Corrected the `convertToJSON` function in `src/pages/index.tsx` to use the actual provider/model returned by the API (stored in state) instead of the user-selected provider, ensuring accurate JSON download metadata.
- **Prompt Enhancement:** Significantly improved the prompt in `src/pages/api/generate-docs.ts` to explicitly request detailed narrative explanations, examples (code, config), and justifications for each documentation section, aiming for higher quality and less outline-like output.
- **Download Markdown Fix:** Refactored the `handleDownload` and `downloadContent` functions in `src/pages/index.tsx` to ensure the Markdown download works reliably. Added checks for content existence, improved filename generation (using actual provider as fallback), added UTF-8 encoding, and made link cleanup more robust.

### Technical Details:
- Added `actualProviderUsed` and `actualModelUsed` state to `CookFastHome`.
- Updated `handleGenerationSuccess` to populate the new state variables.
- Modified `convertToJSON` to read from the new state variables.
- Heavily revised instructions within `buildPrompt` for detailed content generation.
- Added error handling and logging to `downloadContent` and `handleDownload`.
- Ensured correct Blob type and robust cleanup for file downloads.

## [2023-09-20] Final Fixes for Document Generation & Downloads

### Changes:
- **Metadata Fix (JSON Download):** Ensured the actual API provider/model info is correctly passed to and used by the `convertToJSON` function by adding `debugInfo` state and passing it through props, fixing the hardcoded/incorrect metadata issue.
- **Hydration Error Fix:** Adjusted the `MarkdownRenderer` component by adding a custom `p` tag renderer to prevent invalid nesting of block elements (`div`, `pre`) within paragraphs, resolving the console hydration errors.
- **Incorrect Message Fix:** Removed the faulty content length check (`content.length < 2000`) from `MarkdownRenderer` that was incorrectly causing the "Content appears incomplete" message to display for valid sections.
- **Download Markdown Debugging:** Added detailed `console.log` statements to the `handleDownload` function in `src/pages/index.tsx` to trace execution and identify potential failure points in the download process.

### Technical Details:
- Utilized state (`debugInfo`) and prop drilling (`ResultsPanel`) to pass correct API response data to the JSON download function.
- Implemented a custom `p` component in `react-markdown`'s `components` prop to handle block element rendering correctly.
- Removed heuristic length check from `MarkdownRenderer`'s `useEffect`.
- Added granular logging to `handleDownload` for better diagnostics.
