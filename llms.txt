# CookFast

> CookFast is an AI-powered tool that automatically generates comprehensive project documentation, templates, and development guides based on your project details.

CookFast helps developers quickly convert ideas into structured plans, reducing initial project setup time significantly while supporting multiple AI providers (Google Gemini, OpenAI, and Anthropic). The tool leverages large context windows of the latest AI models, including OpenAI GPT-4.1 (1M tokens), Gemini 2.5 Pro (1M+ tokens), and Claude 3.7 Sonnet (200K tokens).

## Supported Project Types
CookFast generates tailored documentation for various project types:

- **Web Applications**: Full-stack web apps with frontend/backend architecture
- **Websites**: Content-focused sites with SEO and performance optimization
- **Mobile Apps**: Native or cross-platform mobile application development
- **API Services**: RESTful or GraphQL API design and implementation
- **Libraries/Packages**: Reusable code modules and development libraries
- **Desktop Applications**: Native desktop software for Windows, macOS, or Linux

## Document Types
CookFast can generate the following planning documents:

- **Project Requirements Document**: Comprehensive breakdown of functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria, and project scope
- **Frontend Guidelines**: Component architecture, state management strategies, styling conventions, responsive design principles, and accessibility standards
- **Backend Structure Proposal**: API design, database schema, authentication flows, middleware configuration, and service architecture
- **Application Flow Diagram**: Visual Mermaid diagrams showing user journeys, data flows, and system interactions
- **Tech Stack Documentation**: Detailed analysis of selected technologies, libraries, frameworks with justifications and alternatives
- **API Documentation**: Endpoint specifications, request/response formats, authentication methods, and error handling
- **File Structure Proposal**: Recommended project organization with directories and key files explained
- **User Interface Design**: Design system guidelines, component library recommendations, and UI patterns
