## üßë‚Äçüç≥ Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. What is CookFast?  
CookFast is an AI-powered tool that automatically generates comprehensive project documentation, templates, and development guides based on your project details. It helps developers quickly convert ideas into structured plans, reducing the initial project setup time significantly.

### 2. What types of projects can CookFast generate documentation for?
CookFast can generate documentation for a wide range of project types including Web Applications, Websites, Mobile Apps, API Services, Libraries/Packages, and Desktop Applications. The tool tailors the documentation based on the specific needs and requirements of each project type.

### 3. Why was CookFast created?
We built CookFast because we often had project ideas (like CookFast itself) and wanted to get started quickly, but planning would take considerable time. We needed a tool that could help us jumpstart projects with AI-powered documentation and planning, allowing us to focus more on implementation rather than initial documentation.

### 4. Why is it called 'CookFast'?
The name 'CookFast' comes from the idea that it helps you 'cook up' (prepare) the basics of your idea quickly. Just as a chef prepares ingredients before cooking, CookFast helps prepare your project's foundation fast, so you can start building immediately.

### 5. Which AI providers does CookFast support?  
CookFast supports four major AI providers with extensive model selection:

**OpenAI Models:**
- GPT-4.1 (1M context, 32K output) - Latest flagship with improved coding
- o3/o3 Pro/o3 Mini (200K context, 65K output) - Advanced reasoning models
- o4 Mini/o4 Mini High (200K context, 32K output) - Optimized reasoning models
- GPT-4o/GPT-4o Mini (128K context, 16K output) - Multimodal capabilities
- Legacy models: GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo

**Google Gemini Models:**
- Gemini 2.5 Pro (1M+ context, 65K output) - Always-on thinking
- Gemini 2.5 Flash (1M+ context, 65K output) - Configurable thinking budget
- Gemini 2.0 Flash (1M context, 32K output) - Next-gen with native tool use
- Legacy models: Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 1.5 Flash

**Anthropic Models:**
- Claude Opus 4 (200K context, 128K output) - Most capable with hybrid reasoning
- Claude Sonnet 4 (200K context, 128K output) - High performance hybrid reasoning
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet (200K context, 64K output) - Extended reasoning enabled
- Legacy models: Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Haiku, Claude 3 Opus

**X.ai Models:**
- Grok 4 (256K context, 32K output) - Frontier-level with always-on reasoning
- Grok 3 (1M context, 16K output) - Advanced reasoning capabilities
- Grok 3 Mini (128K context, 8K output) - Cost-efficient reasoning

### 6. Do I need to provide my own API keys?
Yes, you'll need to provide your own API key for the AI provider you choose to use. This ensures your data security and gives you control over which AI model processes your project information.

### 7. What types of documentation can CookFast generate?
CookFast can generate requirements documents, frontend guidelines, backend architecture, application flow, tech stack documentation, system prompts, and file structure documentation.

### 8. Can I customize the documentation CookFast generates?
Yes! You can customize the documentation by adjusting your project details and selecting specific document types. After generation, you can also download the documentation as Markdown or JSON and then modify it to suit your specific needs. We're also working on more customization options in future updates.

### 9. Is my API key saved?  
No. API keys are validated client-side and never stored by CookFast. They are sent directly to the chosen AI provider for the generation request only.

## üöÄ Deployment

This application is configured for deployment on platforms like Netlify or Vercel which support Next.js applications with API routes. The code is designed to be easily deployable on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or your own server.

### Netlify Blobs Integration

CookFast uses Netlify Blobs for storing generated documents in production environments:

- **Zero Configuration**: Netlify Blobs is automatically configured when deployed on Netlify
- **Persistent Storage**: Documents are stored persistently even through redeployments
- **Local Development**: In local development, files are stored in the `tmp` directory as a fallback
- **High Availability**: Netlify Blobs provides a highly-available, scalable storage solution

To work with Netlify Blobs locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Start Netlify dev environment
npm run netlify:dev

# List all blobs in the store
npm run netlify:blobs:list

# Delete a specific blob
npm run netlify:blobs:delete generationResults/YOUR_REQUEST_ID
```

For more information about Netlify Blobs, see the [documentation](.docs/netlify-blobs.md).
